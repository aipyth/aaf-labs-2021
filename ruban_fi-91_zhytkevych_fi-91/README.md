## Architecture

# Config

You can create `dddb-conf.json` in the directory you execute your binary in order to customize paths where **Indexer** and **Collection Storage** save their files. The DB considers current working directory as directory for **Indexer** and **Storage** by default if the config is not present.

| Field | Explanation | Type |
| ---   | ---         | ---- |
| `storage_path` | Working path for storage | String path |
| `storage_type` | Type of storage to use (currently only filesystem `fs` type is supported) | String |
| `indexer_path` | Working path for indexer | String path |
| `indexer_type` | Type of indexer to use (currently only filesystem `fs` type is supported) | String |

Config `dddb-conf.json` example:
```json
{
	"storage_path": "/tmp/dddb/storage",
	"storage_type": "fs",
	"indexer_path": "/tmp/dddb/indexer",
	"indexer_type": "fs"
}
```
